<h3 align="center">Full‑stack Preact + Express + SSR + MariaDB</h3>

<p>This project combines a lightweight Preact frontend, an Express‑based SSR server, Sequelize ORM, and a MariaDB database. It uses Vite for development and production builds, providing a modern full‑stack setup with server‑side rendering and client hydration.</p>

## Getting Started

- `npm run build` - Builds for production, emitting to `dist/`. Prerenders all found routes in app to static HTML

- `npm run preview` - Starts a server at http://localhost:3000/ to test production build locally
